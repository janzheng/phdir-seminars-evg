        <p>It is not the purpose of this book to try to establish a claim for printing that it is an art. It is hoped
            that it may show that the principles of art may be applied to printing, and that such application may lead
            to improvement in some essentials of printing.</p>
        <p>Thanks are due to several experts in printing who have read the proofs, and have given wise and acceptable
            counsel.</p>
        <p>I desire to acknowledge that aid has been freely sought from books upon art, and that in some instances forms
            of expression have been adopted from them. No originality is claimed for the allusions to art, nor for art
            terms and formulas employed.</p>

        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
            <span class="smcap">Because</span> it is difficult to perfectly transfer a thought from one mind to another
            it is essential that the
            principal medium through which such transference is accomplished may be as perfect as it is possible to make
            it.</p>

        <p>It is not wholly by means of the literal significance of certain forms of words that ideas are given
            currency, whether
            the words are spoken or printed. In speaking it is easy to convey an impression opposed to the literal
            meaning of
            the words employed, by the tone, the expression, the emphasis. It is so also with printed matter. The
            thought or
            idea to be communicated acquires or loses force, directness, clearness, lucidity, beauty, in proportion to
            the fitness
            of the typography employed as a medium.</p>


        <p>It is not primarily a question of beauty of form that is essential in printing, but of the appropriateness of
            form. Beauty
            for itself alone is, in printing, but an accessory quality, to be considered as an aid to the force and
            clarity of the substance of the printed matter.</p>

        <p>An object of art illustrating forms and expressions of beauty subtly suggests esthetic or sensuous emotions,
            which play
            upon the differing consciousnesses of beholders as their capacities and natures enable them to appreciate
            it. The
            impulse received from the art object is individually interpreted and appropriated, and its value to the
            individual
            is determined by each recipient, in accord with his nature, training, and capacity.</p>

        <p>The motive of a piece of printing is driven into the consciousness of the reader with brutal directness, and
            it is one
            of the offices of the typographer to mitigate the severity of the message or to give an added grace to its
            welcome.</p>

        <h1>Art in Printing</h1>

        <p><span class="smcap">There</span> is this vital difference between other objects of art and printing: That our
            association with them is
            purely voluntary, and that printing forces itself upon us at all times and in every relation of life. It is
            impossible
            for a person of intelligence to remove himself from the influence of printing. It confronts him at every
            turn, and
            in every relation of life it plays an important and insistent part.</p>

        <p>Such examples of art as a painting or a piece of statuary exert a certain influence upon a restricted number
            of persons;
            and it is at all times optional with all persons whether they submit themselves to the influence of such art
            objects.
            We are able to evade the influence of other forms of art, but we are not able to ward off printing. To it we
            must
            submit. It is constantly before our eyes; it is forever exerting its power upon our consciousness. It is
            quite possible
            that we may not at present be able to refer any quality of mind, or any degree of
            cultivation, directly to printing, in any form it may have been presented to us; but it is easily
            conceivable that printing
            has a certain influence upon our esthetic life which has been so constant and so habitual as to have escaped
            definite
            recognition.
        </p>

        <p>If we engage our minds in some attempt to realize the quality and extent of pleasure and profit derivable
            from the constant
            influence of printing that conforms to artistic principles, we may perceive that it may be a most powerful
            and effectual
            agency for culture. It is understood that it is the gentle but constant influence that moulds our habits and
            lives
            the more readily and lastingly. If therefore it is possible for us to conceive that the printed page of a
            book may
            illustrate and enforce several of the more elemental and important principles underlying graphic art, we may
            thereby
            realize that printing may readily be employed in the character of a very powerful art educator, if because
            of certain
            inalienable limitations it must be denied full recognition as a member of the sisterhood of arts.</p>

        <p>The book page may be regarded as the protoplasm of all printing. If we examine the relation of principles of
            art to the
            book page we will be able to appreciate the exact importance of those principles in the composition of any
            other form of printing, and to so apply them as to secure results most nearly relating printing to graphic
            art.</p>

        <p>It is the chief characteristic of this uncertain dogma of art in printing that its limitations and variations
            defy the
            conventional forms of expression, and almost require a new vocabulary of art terms. It assuredly requires a
            new and
            a different comprehension of the terms of art, and a distinctly varied comprehension of the word art itself.
            It has
            ever been a stumbling block to printers that the word art as applied to their craft must be given a more
            limited
            significance than is given it in its usual acceptance. If we can come at some intelligible appreciation of
            what we
            mean by art in printing the way will be opened for the application of that motive to the work of the
            presses.</p>

        <p>If we recognize at once the fact that we do not mean exactly what a painter means when we use the word art
            with reference
            to printing, we will have taken the vital step toward a comprehensible employment of the term, as well as
            qualified
            ourselves for an understanding of the results we desire to achieve.</p>

        <p>It is essential that we do not fall into the error of supposing that scientific accuracy is art. It is
            destructive of
            art, and the temptation to put too much stress upon exactitude is a mistake
            the printer must guard himself from with the most sedulous care. It is agreeable to recognize the touch of
            the artist, in
            printing as in other arts, and scientific accuracy is certain to obliterate individuality. It is not the
            cold, lifeless
            abstraction, the shining exemplar of all the precepts and rules of art, that we love and desire, but the
            human note
            speaking through the principles and rules. If the artist is not the dominant note, and the rules submerged
            by the
            personality, there is no value in the object of art. The picture is interesting because the artist expresses
            through
            it his appreciation, his interpretation, of a beautiful thought or a lovely thing. This is what puts the
            most faithful
            photographs outside of the pale of art, and compels the idealization of the performance of the camera before
            it can
            be considered to be artistic. The photograph is not, usually, true to our view of life. If it is indeed true
            to life
            it represents a view of life that is quite strange to us, and often distasteful. We are not familiar with
            the uncouth
            animal the photograph shows us the horse in action to be, and we will not accept that caricature as the real
            horse.
            The horse that is real to us is the animal we see with our eyes, and the horse in art must be the animal we
            see plus
            the artist's logical idealization. The facts are the same with regard to nearly all of the
            work of the camera, and with regard to other attempts at scientific accuracy in art. It is foreign to our
            experience, and
            does violence to our ideals. We actually see no such automatons as photography shows us men in action are,
            and we
            can never accept such disillusionment. If it is attempted in the name of art we will turn upon art and throw
            it out
            of our lives.</p>

        <figure id="figure-1">
            <img src="book/images/letterpress-printing.jpg">
            <figcaption>Letterpress printing. the kindly romance nature has made a necessary adjunct to our powers of
                vision</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>It is the irredeemable fault of some processes employed in printing that they are too scientifically
            accurate. This is
            the legitimate argument against the halftone plate as contrasted with the line engraving or the
            reproductions of
            pen-and-ink work, etc. The halftone is too accurate. It brings us face to face with the stark reality, and
            brushes
            away all the kindly romance nature has made a necessary adjunct to our powers of vision. Attempts to restore
            this
            quality to halftones with the graver are only partially successful, as the defect is too deep seated, too
            radically
            fundamental. Some other processes, other than reproductive processes, employed in printing are exposed to
            this danger
            of too much scientific accuracy, producing results that have no warmth, no sympathy, no human power.
            Printing is
            peculiarly the victim of this cold formality of sentiment, and must be considered as upon that plane. But
            this fact
            makes the obligation to be alive to every
            opportunity to mitigate its severity the more pressing upon every printer who dreams of his work as of an
            art, and the closer
            the sympathy between the printer and the culture of art the more warmth and humanity he will be able to
            infuse into
            his work.</p>

        <p>Some of the principles of art have a fundamental relation to printing, while some have an influence upon it
            so illusive
            as to defy definition, and compel us to look upon the connection as something no more substantial than
            feeling. Indeed,
            the whole matter of the application of art principles to printing may not unfairly be considered to be one
            of feeling;
            involving the saturation of the printer with the rules and tenets of art and the adding thereto of a fine
            discrimination
            tempered by a resolute philistinism, and then the play of his cultivated individuality upon the typography.
        </p>

        <p>Principles and rules of art for the printer's guidance must be more mobile than can be permitted for the
            guidance of
            the painter, the draughtsman, the engraver, or the sculptor, because the medium for the expression of the
            printer's
            conception is so nearly immobile. It is the reverse of the general conception: The rule must adapt itself to
            the
            medium and to the circumstances, at least so far as the measure of its observance is concerned, if not in
            some
            emergencies where its principle is also at stake. It is conceivable in printing that emergencies may occur
            making it imperative
            to ignore the primary rules of composition, of proportion, of balance, or of perspective; it may be
            necessary to
            even do violence to principles relating to color or to tone. Such emergencies must be exceedingly rare, but
            that
            we are forced to regard them as possible emphasizes the subtle difference between art and art in printing.
            There
            can be no good art if the principles of art are violated in execution; there may be good printing if the
            principles
            of art are occasionally modified or even ignored.</p>

        <p>The motive of printing is not primarily an art motive. It is a utilitarian motive. In printing therefore art
            is to be
            invoked for guidance only so far as it will lend itself to the expression of the motive. It is never, in
            printing,
            "art for art's sake"; it is ever art for printing's sake. We do not print to illustrate art, nor to produce
            objects
            of art. We print to spread intelligence&mdash;to make knowledge available to all who will read. A painted
            picture,
            if of a high order of art, is meant to appeal to a sentiment but slightly connected with the "story" of the
            picture.
            The appreciative observer of a good painting gives little thought to the "story," to the literary motive,
            but is
            absorbed in seeking for the artistic motive, in order that he may yield himself to the charm of the work of
            art; he seeks "art for art's sake."</p>

        <p>In printing it is the "story" that is told; it is the literary motive that must be considered, first and most
            anxiously.
            Nothing may interfere&mdash;not even art. The shaft of the "story" must go, swift and true, straight into
            the comprehension
            of the reader. This is the constant anxiety of the printer. The literary motive must not be encumbered. It
            must be
            freed from the mechanics of the printed page absolutely. This is the printer's problem. He must not seek to
            attract
            to his mechanics. It is the essence of his art that he liberate ideas and send them forth with no ruffled
            pinions,
            no evident signs of the pent-house page from which they wing their way.</p>

        <p>The printer's work and the painter's art exactly reverse their processes, as their motives are opposed; but
            they must
            both work with the same tools, measurably. Everything with the painter is plastic, except his art.
            Everything is
            immobile with the printer, except his art; and of that he hopes to employ only so much as will gild the
            prosaic commercialism
            of the motive he must express. The chief principles and tenets of art are all applicable to the craft of
            printing,
            in some degree. Drawing, composition, harmony, balance, proportion, perspective, color, tone,
            light-and-shade, values, etc., are qualities of graphic art that
            apply to printing with varying force, according to the exigencies of each particular case in hand, and
            particularly
            according to the comprehension and cultivation of the printer. It is always possible to explain the beauty
            and power
            of any piece of printing by reference to the same principles that are responsible for the excellencies of
            other works
            of graphic art. It is therefore logical to assume that those principles which explain the excellencies of
            printing
            are responsible for them.</p>

        <p>It is evident that the value of these art qualities in printing must depend upon the care and intelligence
            exercised
            in their application. They are refinements upon the usual and primary practices of printing, and unless they
            can
            be employed with full sympathy and knowledge, as well as with the artistic spirit and comprehension, they
            will appeal
            to the printer in vain.
        </p>

        <p>The question with the printer is: Is it worth while to give my work all the beauty and distinction and power
            possible?
            If it is decided that it is profitable to execute work as worthily as it is possible to execute it, the
            printer will
            not be satisfied if he does not devote himself to a study of this phase of his craft, and a study of
            sufficient breadth and thoroughness to give him a reliable basis of
            knowledge and the resultant self-confidence. Having proceeded thus far he will not fail to apply all these
            art tenets
            to the full extent of his knowledge and their adaptability.

        <h1>Specifications</h1>

        <p>The paper in this book is French handmade, 16 &times; 20&ndash;29, imported by the Japan Paper Company of New
            York, and
            catalogued as No. 333.</p>

        <p>The type is a liberal modification of the Caslon, 12 point. It was designed and cast by the Boston branch of
            the American
            Type Founders Company, and had never been used until set for this book.</p>

        <p>The binding is according to the specifications of the Society of Arts, of London. The sheets are folded with
            special
            care, end papers are made with zigzag and sewn on, edges are uncut, signatures are sewn with unbleached
            thread over
            three unbleached linen tapes, back left nearly square, boards of the best black millboard, covers of
            imported marbled
            paper, and the backs of art vellum, with paper label. The binding was executed by the regular force of
            workmen and
            in the regular routine of commercial work.</p>

        <p>The composition of the type was by a journeyman and an apprentice, and the presswork was done on a half super
            royal Colt's
            Armory press. No attempt has been made to execute the work in other than the ordinary manner, with ordinary
            appliances and ordinary
            workmen. All the material is such as is regularly carried in stock by dealers.</p>
